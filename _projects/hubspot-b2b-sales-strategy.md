## Overview  
Developed a B2B sales and CRM implementation strategy for Chicago Event Management (CEM), a large-scale race production organization. The project focused on identifying operational inefficiencies and presenting a tailored HubSpot solution to streamline communication, sponsorship management, and participant engagement.

## Business Understanding  
Analyzed CEM’s complex event environment, including:
- Multi-platform registration systems
- Manual spreadsheet tracking
- Seasonal staffing challenges
- Disconnected communication tools

Identified key pain points impacting efficiency, sponsor retention, and race-day execution.

## Strategic Solution  
Recommended a HubSpot ecosystem including:
- **CRM & Contact Management** for unified runner, sponsor, and volunteer tracking  
- **Marketing Hub** for automated race communications  
- **Sales Hub** for sponsor outreach and renewals  
- **Service Hub** for participant support management  
- **Reporting Dashboards** for real-time operational insights  

## Value Proposition  
- Reduced manual workload during race season  
- Increased sponsor retention and communication clarity  
- Improved participant engagement  
- Enhanced scalability for growing race portfolios  

## Recommended Next Step
